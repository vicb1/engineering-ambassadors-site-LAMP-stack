        <p>
           RPI Engineering Ambassadors (EA) program is managed through the School of Engineering – Educational Outreach Center. 
           EAs are an assembly of highly motivated students that are focused on inspiring a younger audience to explore the role 
           of engineers in society. We participate in an extensive communications and professional development training to learn 
           the techniques that enable us to develop engaging presentations, hands-on demonstrations to take in to classrooms. EAs
            participate in 12 – 15 full day visits into regional middle and high school classrooms throughout the academic year 
            and encourage over 3000 students to consider careers in the areas of science, technology and engineering.

            <p class="descrip"><i>"Engineering ambassadors has helped me grow both personally and professionally. My 
              communication and presentation skills have flourished due to both our extensive training 
              and experience presenting to many different audiences. My leadership skills have grown 
              from leading groups of middle and high school students through activities as well as planning
              and leading EA trips to local schools. Finally my network has grown through creating lasting 
              friendships with EAs from other schools and making connections with professionals at 
              internships."</i>

              engineering ambassador, you have to command attention in order to share your passions with 
              others, and the confidence boost that comes with being a part of this program has changed the 
              way I interact with classmates and professionals, and I'm a much stronger leader now than ever 
              before.”</i>

            <p class="descrip"><i>Engineering Ambassadors has provided me with an amazing opportunity to help me develop my 
              communication skills. It has also allowed me to interact with younger students and hopefully convince 
              them to become engineers in the future. It is amazing to see the expression on student’s faces as they 
              see how simple things they see every day has so much involved into design and production of the 
              objects. </i>
